# block switch

A pattern matching puzzle game with a twist! When the title-block is green the pattern is normal, but when the title-block is red the pattern is reversed! In essence, the game builds the pattern at the, "beginning" and the "end" and it's the players job to keep up for as long as possible!

## Motivation

This project was born out of my desire to create a puzzle game that is both simple as well as challenging. Something that would be very familiar to most, yet different in some kind of specific and more challenging way.
